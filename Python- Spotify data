This newbie project deals with the analysis of the attributes of the Spotify data. The project mainly focuses on the factors effecting the measure of ‘Valence’ in the Spotify dataset. 
After the proper exploratory analysis of the data, it has been discovered that the primary factors influencing the target variable is very noisy and has a lot of outliers in it. 
Therefore the ouliers are handled in order to make an useful use of those and replacing it with a sensible value. 
In the end, a Multiple Linear Regression model has been built and in order to access the accuracy of the model, R2 score is used as an evaluation factor.
